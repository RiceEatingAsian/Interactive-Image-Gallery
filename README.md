# Interactive-Image-Gallery
This is a simple, client-side interactive image gallery built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM manipulation).

# Interactive Image Gallery (Vanilla JS DOM)

## Description

This project is a simple, client-side interactive image gallery. It uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** to demonstrate fundamental DOM manipulation by allowing a user to click thumbnail images to change the main displayed image.

## Features

* **Image Swapping:** Clicking a thumbnail updates the `src` attribute of the main image.
* **Active State:** The currently selected thumbnail is highlighted via a CSS class.
* **No Frameworks:** Built using pure JavaScript for efficient DOM interaction.

## Usage

Click on any of the smaller thumbnail images at the bottom to instantly view the large version in the main display area above.

## Files

* `index.html`: Contains the gallery structure.
* `style.css`: Handles presentation and layout.
* `script.js`: Handles click events and DOM updates.
* `images/`: Directory for all image assets.
